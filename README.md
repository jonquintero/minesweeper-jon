## About

I didn't want to spend much time to built some basic function on this app.
Was development with Vue SPA.
You can:
-Create game
-Select quantity of rows, columns and mines.
-Save game.
-Save mines position.
-Save cells revealed.
-Destroy cells revealed when the page is reload.
-You cannot change position of mines is de the page is reload.
-Tracking time the game
-Emit alert is lost game or win game

More of function was built in the view (Vue component) so saving the data you can built the game that has been saved (this function in the view, doesn't was development)
